# Scramble Against Peers

Okay, so why am I cloning Scramble with Friends? Because I have a Windows Phone and it's quite sad that I can't play scramble with friends on it. So what am I going to do to Microsoft's completely ignored platform? I'm going to try to make something with it. 

Well, it's not going to be that easy especially since I don't use Windows and the browser component of Mango really really sucks. I mean it's a huge improvement from the older versions of internet explorer, but it still doesn't support touch events and keyframe animations and I don't know when Windows 7.8 is coming out so I can't plan accordingly.
 
Also, almost all my time now is spent split across Linux computers, so there's not much Windows for me to access and to try to make that app. Though I am technically dual booting with Windows on my home computer, I haven't booted into Windows there for a veritable eternity.
